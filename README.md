# Akira Bot

The bot used to manage the point system for a 100+ player game. This bot also includes other commands created when I was first learning the Discord.js framework (which is also why the code is a bit messy).

## Functionalities

-   Add/Subtract from player balance
-   Create new player
-   Calculate leaderboards
-   Many custom commands for fun

## Thanks

Special thanks to [Thomas](https://github.com/thomas-crane) for creating an additional wrapper for the Discord.js framework! â™¥
